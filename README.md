## Day 01 - 14
The development in these 14 days was about getting started and familiar with SwiftUI. I have never used SwiftUI ever before and was just learning by doing. Through my programming language I can tell that I came really quickly into SwiftUI and understood the most things very fast. I was building on top my programming experiences from C#. As a C# enthusiast it felt quite easy to get in SwiftUI. 
- Request sending and Response retreiving between Client(SwiftUI) and Server(ASP.NET Core) is done.
- The authentication is finished. User's can be registered in the SwiftUI application and existing User's can log in in the mobile application. All User transactions are made by the ASP.NET Core Web API, these two tech stacks are connceted and communicating via HTTP. The database schema is SQLite for development porpuses but will lately be switched to PostgreSQL or SQL Server.


### Day 01
